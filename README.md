# Subject: Operating Systems

This repository is a result of projects which I designed and implemented in Operating System class at Hanyang University. Most of the projects was adding new features to [xv6](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public), which is maintained by MIT. It was great time to understand operating systems which had seemed just like magic.

## Project 0: Simple Unix Shell

It was warming-up project. Mimicking simple unix shell taught me how programs are executed through system calls.
